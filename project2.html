        <h2 id="jollof-rice">Jollof Rice</h2>
        <p>Jollof rice is a beloved West African dish with many regional variations. It's made with a unique blend of spices, long-grain rice, and a tomato and red pepper base. It is often served as a hearty entrée by adding beef, chicken, goat, or fish, or as is as a side. Jollof rice can be made for any occasion from birthdays and holiday celebrations to a casual weeknight dinner.</p>

        <ol><strong>Cooking Steps</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <strong><li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.
</li> </strong>   <br>

        <strong><li>Prepare the pepper stew base:
</li> </strong>
        <p>Add the bell peppers, tomato, onion, scotch bonnet or habanero pepper, ginger, and garlic into a blender, and blend until smooth. Set aside.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Fry the onions:
</li> </strong> 
        <p>Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven (mine holds 3 quarts) or a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the onions and fry for 2 to 3 minutes, until fragrant and the edges get a little brown. <br>

Scoop out about a third of the fried onions on a small plate or bowl, and set it aside. You will use it to top the jollof rice at the end.</p>

        <strong><li>Cook the tomato paste: 
</li> </strong>  
        <p>Add the tomato paste and cook it for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently. The oil should turn red and the paste should look grainy. Reduce the heat if the paste starts sticking to the bottom of the pot and burning.</p>
        <strong><li>Cook the pepper stew base:
</li> </strong>   
        <p>Carefully stir in pepper stew base, and cook it uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes until reduced by about half. Stir the mixture occasionally with a wooden spoon and scrape up any bits that stick to the bottom of the pot. <br>

The mixture will splatter quite a bit! Keep it covered with a splatter guard or place a lid on top slightly ajar so that moisture can escape. Adjust the heat as needed if you notice it burning or if it’s not simmering.</p>

        <strong><li>Add the rice and seasonings: 
</li> </strong> 
        <p>Stir in the rice, curry powder, bouillon cube, dried thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, nutmeg, bay leaves, and salt. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Then add the chicken stock, and bring it to a simmer.

</p>
        <strong><li>Bake the jollof rice: 
</li> </strong>   
        <p>Turn the heat off and tightly cover the pot with foil and a lid. Transfer the pot into the preheated oven and bake, undisturbed, for about 40 minutes.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Add butter and peas:
</li> </strong>  
        <p>If using the butter and peas (I highly recommend it!), remove the pot from the oven and dollop the pats of butter on top. Sprinkle the peas and the reserved fried onions on top too. Cover the pot again with the foil and lid, and bake for 5 minutes.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Serve:
</li> </strong>   
        <p>Gently stir the rice to incorporate the butter, peas, and onions. Discard the bay leaves and transfer the rice to a platter, if you’d like. Serve warm. <br>

Store leftovers tightly covered in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Reheat in the microwave in 1-minute intervals until heated through.</p>

        <p>Turkey meatball recipe is truly a representation of my Caribbean-American heritage where a beloved Jamaican flavor meets a favorite American style of serving meat. The only specialty ingredient you’ll need is a jar of jerk seasoning.</p>

        <ol> <strong>Cooking Steps</strong> 
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <strong><li>Preheat the oven to 400°F:
</li> </strong>
        <p>Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray modestly with cooking oil.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Combine the ingredients:
</li> </strong>
        <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground turkey, jerk seasoning, ginger, habanero peppers, garlic, green and yellow onions, and thyme. Add the paprika, black pepper, salt and breadcrumbs.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Mix the turkey mixture:
</li> </strong>
        <p>Using a small spatula, mix all the ingredients together. Make cutting motions with spatula until the ingredients look evenly mixed. Use the spatula to fold the meat a few times from the sides into the center to make sure the turkey on the bottom of the bowl gets properly mixed in. You can also use your hands to gently mix it all together. As soon as the ingredients look fairly distributed, stop mixing.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Shape the meatballs:
</li> </strong>
        <p>Use your fingers or a 1-tablespoon measure to scoop out the turkey mixture into the palm of your hands. Two tablespoons will give you a medium-large meatball; one rounded tablespoon, smaller sized meatballs. 
<br>
Gently form it into a ball using both palms. Do not smash or put pressure when forming the shape. Place on the prepared baking sheet leaving a little space between each meatball. Repeat this step until all the turkey mixture is used up.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Bake the meatballs:
</li> </strong>
        <p>Bake the meatballs for 20-25 minutes until browned. If you prefer using a thermometer it should read 165°F when inserted. You can also just cut into one and check if it is firm and cooked through.
<br>
You’ll notice a thick white ring around the bottom of each meatball. Don’t be alarmed, this is just the fat from the turkey released during the cooking process. The tops won’t get very brown, but if you’d like a little more color, leave the pan in the oven and turn the broiler on to 525°F for 2-3 minutes.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Serve:
</li> </strong>
        <p>These meatballs are juicy and have so much flavor that they are perfect on their own, so there’s not much need for a dipping sauce. However, you can brush a little bit of guava jelly or apricot jam on top or serve with your favorite chutney.
<br>
Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 4 days. If freezing, I prefer to cook the meatballs first, cool, then put them in a freezer bag and freeze for up to 2 months. When you are ready to eat, bake them at 350°F for 10-15 minutes.</p>

        <br>
        
        <strong><li>Make the marinade:
</li> </strong>
        <p>Place the paprika, salt, pepper, sugar, cumin, thyme, basil, garlic, onion, cilantro leaves, chili peppers, olive oil, vinegar, and lemon juice into a food processor. Blend for 60 seconds or until you have a smooth sauce.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Pat chicken dry:
</li> </strong>
        <p>Pat the chicken pieces dry using a paper towel and place the chicken pieces in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Marinate the chicken:
</li> </strong>
        <p>Pour half of the marinade over the chicken making sure to coat both sides of the chicken. Cover with aluminum foil and place the baking dish in the fridge. Marinate the chicken for 3 hours or up to 24 hours.
<br>
Place the remaining marinade in an airtight container and store in the fridge until ready to make pan sauce.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Preheat the oven to 400°F.
</li> </strong>
        <p>When ready to cook the chicken, preheat the oven and remove the chicken from the fridge and take off the foil.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Roast the chicken:
</li> </strong>
        <p>Roast the chicken uncovered for 50 to 60 minutes or until the temperature reaches 165 degrees when inserted with a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Make the pan sauce:
</li> </strong>
        <p>Right before you’re ready to serve, make the pan sauce. In a small saucepan over medium-low heat add the remaining marinade. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce heats through, about 2 minutes.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Serve:
</li> </strong>
        <p>Spoon the pan sauce over the chicken and garnish with cilantro. Serve with a side dish of your choosing.</p>
